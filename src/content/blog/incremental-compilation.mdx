    Over the past week I've been trying to understand rust's incremental compilation model
    by implementing it myself. The one inside [rustc](https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/queries/incremental-compilation.html) is already very
    well documented, but the implementation lives inside of a giant compiler. Maybe this is a little more accessible to you!
draft: false
time: "5 minutes"

This blog post is going to be a short one, since most of the things I wanted to say I ended up writing in the documentation of the crate I published
containing the implementation. As I write more there, I might decide I have more to talk about, but for now the documentation itself should be a pretty
interesting read, one I'd otherwise put in a blog post. If you're interested, you can find it [here](https://docs.rs/incremental-query/latest/incremental_query/)!
